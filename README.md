# Sculptured keycaps for ErgoDox migrated to KeyV2 by Nosezeichen
* Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4241843

This is a remix of the very cool [sculptured ergodox layout by v6ak](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3271490) migrated to the great [KeyV2 by rsheldii](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2783650).

Props and thanks to you both for helping me create these keycaps!

I have done the migration because I wanted legends on my keycaps (on the front of the keycap).

Rest of the description will follow when the implementation is finished.

Right now you can check out the current state on my github:
- [My GitHub: Ergodox sculptured keycaps based on KeyV2](https://github.com/AhmetBilgin/KeyV2/tree/flat-sided-keycaps/ergodox_keycaps)
- Just run make on this folder to create STL's for each key.
- Print the caps on their side! This will make them feel smoother when typing!
- Print in sequential mode, e.g. print a keycap fully and then the next keycap.
- I used about 20% infill. Choose like you want.
